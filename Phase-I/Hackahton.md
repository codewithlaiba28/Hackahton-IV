# **1\. Executive Summary**

## **1.1 The Challenge**

Build a **Course Companion FTE** — a Digital Full-Time Equivalent that serves as a 24/7 educational tutor, working 168 hours per week at 85-90% cost savings compared to human tutors.

## **1.2 The Innovation**

This hackathon applies the [**Agent Factory Architecture**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15GuwZwIOQy_g1XsIJjQsFNHCTQTWoXQhWGVMhiH0swc/edit?usp=sharing) to education:

* **General Agents (Claude Code)** manufacture the Custom Agent using Spec-Driven Development  
* **Custom Agents (Digital FTE)** deliver tutoring at scale with enterprise-grade reliability  
* **Dual Frontends** \- ChatGPT App (Phase 1 and 2\) \+ Web (Phase 3\) provide maximum reach  
* **Zero-Backend-LLM Default** ensures cost efficiency and scalability (Phase 1\)

## **1.3 The Outcome**

A production-ready Digital FTE that can:

* Tutor thousands of students simultaneously  
* Operate 24/7 without fatigue  
* Students can use the app from inside ChatGPT or a stand alone Web App  
* Maintain 99%+ consistency in educational delivery  
* Scale from 10 to 100,000 users without linear cost increase

The hackathon enforces a modern AI architecture principle: start with a Zero‑Backend‑LLM architecture (see Appendix I) by default (Phase 1), and introduce Hybrid intelligence (Phase 2\) only where it is demonstrably valuable, cost‑justified, and premium. In Phase 3 a stand alone end-to-end Web App is required to be built with full features.

# **2\. The Digital FTE Thesis**

*"In the AI era, the most valuable educational platforms won't sell courses — they'll hire Digital Tutors that work 168 hours per week, powered by agents, specs, skills, MCP, and cloud-native technologies."*

## **2.1 Human Tutor vs Digital FTE Comparison**

| Feature | Human Tutor | Course Companion FTE |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Availability | 40 hours/week | 168 hours/week (24/7) |
| Monthly Cost | $2,000 – $5,000 | $200 – $500 |
| Students per Tutor | 20-50 | Unlimited (concurrent) |
| Consistency | Variable (85–95%) | Predictable (99%+) |
| Ramp-up Time | Weeks of training | Instant (via SKILL.md) |
| Personalization | Limited by time | Infinite patience |
| Cost per Session | $25 – $100 | $0.10 – $0.50 |
| Language Support | 1-3 languages | 50+ languages |

### **The 'Aha\!' Moment**

A Digital Tutor FTE can conduct **50,000+ tutoring sessions per month** at approximately **$0.25 per session** — compared to $50+ for human tutoring. This represents a **99% cost reduction** while maintaining quality through guardrails and Agent Skills.

# **3\. Project Overview**

## **3.1 What You're Building**

An **AI-Native Course Companion** that:

1. **Teaches** — Delivers course content with intelligent navigation  
2. **Explains** — Breaks down concepts at the learner's level  
3. **Quizzes** — Tests understanding with immediate feedback  
4. **Tracks** — Monitors progress and identifies knowledge gaps  
5. **Adapts** — Adjusts difficulty and approach (Phase 2\) 

6. **Web App** — Provides a Comprehensive Stand Alone Web App (Phase 3\)

## **3.2 Dual Frontend Architecture**

Teams must build two frontends that share backend features but separate code base:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| ChatGPT App Frontend (Phase 1\) | OpenAI Apps SDK | Conversational UI, 800M+ user reach |
| Deterministic Backend (Phase 1\) | FastAPI (Python) | Content APIs, Quiz APIs, Progress APIs |
| Hybrid Backend (Phase 2\) | FastAPI (Python) \+ LLM API Calls | Paid Premium Features |
| Web Frontend (Phase 3\) | Next.js / React | Full LMS dashboard, progress visuals, admin features |
| Consolidated Backend (Phase 3\) | FastAPI (Python) \+ LLM API Calls | All Features |
| Content Storage (Phase 1, 2, and 3\) | Cloudflare R2 | Course content, media assets, quiz banks |

## **3.3 Course Content Options**

Teams must choose **ONE** course topic to build their FTE around:

| Option | Course Topic | Suggested Content |
| :---: | ----- | ----- |
| A | AI Agent Development | Claude Agent SDK concepts, MCP, Agent Skills |
| B | Cloud-Native Python | FastAPI, Containers, Kubernetes basics |
| C | Generative AI Fundamentals | LLMs, Prompting, RAG, Fine-tuning |
| D | Modern Python | Modern Python with Typing |

# **4\. Architecture Overview**

## **4.1 Agent Factory Context**

This project implements the [**Agent Factory Architecture**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15GuwZwIOQy_g1XsIJjQsFNHCTQTWoXQhWGVMhiH0swc/edit?usp=sharing) where:

* **You (the team)** write the **Spec** (requirements, guardrails, skills)  
* **General Agent (Claude Code)** manufactures the **Custom Agent** code  
* **Custom Agent (Course Companion FTE)** runs in production serving students

## **4.2 Technical Stack Layers**

Following the Agent Factory 8-layer architecture:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose | Phase |
| :---: | ----- | ----- | :---: |
| L0 | Agent Sandbox (gVisor) | Secure execution | Phase 2 and 3 |
| L1 | Apache Kafka | Event backbone | Phase 2 and 3 |
| L2 | Dapr \+ Workflows | Infrastructure \+ Durability | Phase 2 and 3 |
| L3 | FastAPI | HTTP interface \+ A2A | **Phase 1, 2, and 3** |
| L4 | OpenAI Agents SDK | High-level orchestration | Phase 2 and 3 |
| L5 | Claude Agent SDK | Agentic execution | Phase 2 and 3 |
| L6 | Runtime Skills \+ MCP | Domain knowledge \+ Tools | **Phase 1, 2, and 3** |
| L7 | A2A Protocol | Multi-FTE collaboration | Phase 2 and 3 |

**Phase 1 Focus:** L3 (FastAPI) \+ L6 (Skills \+ MCP) — Deterministic backend  
**Phase 2 Addition:** L4 \+ L5 (Hybrid SDK) for premium features

## **4.3 Zero-Backend-LLM Architecture Principle**

**Key Insight:** In Phase 1, ChatGPT does ALL the intelligent work. Your backend is purely deterministic — serving content, tracking progress, and enforcing rules. This means **near-zero marginal cost** per user.

| Backend Responsibilities | ChatGPT Responsibilities |
| ----- | ----- |
| Serve content verbatim from R2 Track progress and streaks Grade quizzes (rule-based) Enforce access control Search content (keyword/embedding) | Explain concepts at learner's level Provide analogies and examples Answer questions from content Encourage and motivate Adapt tone to student |

# **5\. Phase 1 ChatGPT App: Zero-Backend-LLM**

## **5.1 Phase 1 Goal**

Build a **fully functional Course Companion** where:

* **Backend** performs ZERO LLM inference  
* **ChatGPT** handles ALL explanation, tutoring, and adaptation  
* **System** is production-viable and can scale to 100k+ users cheaply

## **5.2 Architecture Rules (STRICT)**

Zero‑Backend‑LLM:  
User → ChatGPT App → Deterministic Backend

### **✅ ALLOWED in Backend**

| Component | Purpose | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Content APIs | Serve course material | GET /chapters/{id} |
| Navigation APIs | Chapter sequencing | GET /chapters/{id}/next |
| Quiz APIs | Rule-based grading | POST /quizzes/{id}/submit |
| Progress APIs | Track completion | PUT /progress/{user\_id} |
| Search APIs | Keyword/semantic search | GET /search?q=neural+networks |
| Access Control | Freemium gating | GET /access/check |

### **❌ NOT ALLOWED in Backend**

| Forbidden | Why |
| ----- | ----- |
| LLM API calls | Violates Zero-Backend-LLM |
| RAG summarization | LLM inference |
| Prompt orchestration | LLM inference |
| Agent loops | Must be in ChatGPT |
| Content generation | Pre-generate only |

## **5.3 Required Features (Phase 1\)**

All teams must implement these 6 features in Phase 1:

| \# | Feature | Backend Does | ChatGPT Does |
| :---: | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Content Delivery | Serve content verbatim | Explain at learner's level |
| 2 | Navigation | Return next/previous chapters | Suggest optimal path |
| 3 | Grounded Q\&A | Return relevant sections | Answer using content only |
| 4 | Rule-Based Quizzes | Grade with answer key | Present, encourage, explain |
| 5 | Progress Tracking | Store completion, streaks | Celebrate, motivate |
| 6 | Freemium Gate | Check access rights | Explain premium gracefully |

## 

## **5.4 Disqualification Criteria**

**Teams are IMMEDIATELY DISQUALIFIED from Phase 1 if the backend contains ANY LLM API calls, summarization logic, or agent loops. Detection method: Code review \+ API audit.**

**![][image1]**

# **6\. Phase 2 ChatGPT App: Hybrid Intelligence (Paid Premium)**

## **6.1 Phase 2 Goal**

Add **selective backend intelligence** that:

* Delivers clear additional educational value  
* Is cost-justified as a premium feature  
* Is cleanly isolated from Phase 1 logic

Teams must explain why each hybrid feature cannot be implemented using zero‑LLM design.

Hybrid ChatGPT App:  
User → ChatGPT App → Backend → LLM APIs

6.2 Phase 2 Rules

| ✅ Hybrid intelligence MUST be: | ❌ You may NOT: |
| ----- | ----- |
| Feature-scoped (limited to specific features) User-initiated (user requests it) Premium-gated (paid users only) Isolated (separate API routes) Cost-tracked (monitor per-user cost) | Convert entire app to hybrid Auto-trigger hybrid features Make hybrid required for core UX Hide hybrid costs from analysis |

## **6.3 Allowed Hybrid Features (Choose Up to 2\)**

| Feature | What It Does | Why It Needs LLM |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A. Adaptive Learning Path | Analyzes patterns, generates personalized recommendations | Requires reasoning over learning data |
| B. LLM-Graded Assessments | Evaluates free-form written answers with detailed feedback | Rule-based can't evaluate reasoning |
| C. Cross-Chapter Synthesis | Connects concepts across chapters, generates "big picture" | Requires multi-document reasoning |
| D. AI Mentor Agent | Long-running agent for complex tutoring workflows | Multi-turn problem solving |
